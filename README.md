# Capacitive Moisture Sensor
A sensor used to detect the present soil moisture through a change in capacitance. 
The PCB has designed in KiCad and uses an interdigital capacitor design.
The output signal from this board is a PWM with frequency that changes
relative to the capacitance (soil moisture).
